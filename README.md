# DiabetesPredictionProject

This project focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using Support Vector Classification (SVC). I utilized a dataset with various health indicators and demographic features to train the model. The SVC algorithm effectively classified individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic categories based on their medical data. The early prediction of diabetes has significant implications for preventive healthcare and personalized treatment. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics and highlighted the importance of early intervention.
